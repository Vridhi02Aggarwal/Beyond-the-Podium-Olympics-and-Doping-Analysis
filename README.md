# Beyond the Podium: A Deep Dive into Doping and Olympic Trends

> **Unmasking the shadows of Olympic triumphs through data.**

## 📊 Project Overview

"Beyond the Podium" is an analytical deep dive into the darker side of the Olympic Games—doping. This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to examine the historical patterns, trends, and red flags associated with doping cases. It seeks to identify potential areas of concern, predict possible violations, and uncover insights often overshadowed by medals and records.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Analyze doping trends across different Olympic years, sports, and countries.
- Identify correlations between doping cases and socio-political or economic factors.
- Use predictive analytics to highlight potential future risks.
- Visualize findings through compelling graphs and dashboards.

## 🗃️ Dataset

The analysis is based on the publicly available **Olympics and doping dataset**, consisting of:
- Athlete bios
- Doping violation records
- Medal distributions
- Historical event data

*(Details on how to obtain or replicate the dataset are in the `data/` folder or via the notebook instructions.)*

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Normalizing and merging datasets for consistent identifiers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns using visual and statistical tools.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic regression and decision tree classifiers for doping prediction.
- **Clustering**: Unsupervised methods to detect anomalous patterns in country-wise participation and violations.
- **Visualization**: Interactive and static graphs for intuitive insight delivery.

## 📈 Visual Highlights

- Temporal heatmaps of doping incidents by country.
- Radar plots of doping cases by sport.
- Clustered bar charts comparing medals vs. violations.
- Predictive model outputs with confusion matrices.
